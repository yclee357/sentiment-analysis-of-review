# Sentiment Analysis of Steam Review

For this project, we will analyze reviews of the games at the Steam Store. Unlike traditional products, 
digital products like games mostly can only be purchased online. Furthermore, game developers and publishers nowadays rarely release a 
demo before they launch the game. Therefore, content such as videos and reviews of gameplaying may be the important source that 
people can have a general idea about players’ gaming experience before they buy the product. Reviews at Steam Store have a good 
metadata ecosystem for data analytics (e.g. reviews have a “helpful” score, “funny” score, number of hours the reviewer played 
the game…etc.).
